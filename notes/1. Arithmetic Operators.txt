 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations.

Operator    Description 	Example Result
+	       Addition	        2 + 3     5
-	    Subtraction	        5 - 2	  3
*	 Multiplication	        4 * 3	  12
/	    Division	       10 / 2    5.0
//	 Floor Division	       7 // 2	  3
%	 Modulus (Remainder)    7 % 2	  1
**	 Exponent (Power)       2 ** 3	  8

âœ… 2. Assignment Operator
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
  =	      Assign value	a = 5

âœ… 3. Arithmetic Assignment Operators
Combines arithmetic and assignment.

Operator	Example	Equivalent To
 +=	        a += 3	a = a + 3
-=	        a -= 2	a = a - 2
*=	        a *= 2	a = a * 2
/=	        a /= 2	a = a / 2
//=	       a //= 2	a = a // 2
%=	       a %= 2	a = a % 2
**=	       a **= 3	a = a ** 3

âœ… 4. Comparison (Relational) Operators
Used to compare values. Returns True or False.

Operator	Description	Example	Result
==	        Equal to	5 == 5	True
!=	        Not equal to	5 != 3	True
<	       Less than	2 < 5	True
<=	     Less than or equal	3 <= 3	True
>	    Greater than	4 > 2	True
>=	Greater than or equal	6 >= 3	True

âœ… 5. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	     Description	Example	               Result
and	    True if both are true 	(5 > 2 and 3 < 4)	True
or	True if at least one is true	(5 > 2 or 3 > 5)	True
not	      Negates the result	not(5 > 2)	        False

âœ… 6. Membership Operators
Used to test if a value is in a sequence (like a string, list, etc.)

Operator	Description	           Example	                 Result
in	True if value exists	        'a' in 'apple'	                 True
not in	True if value does not exist	'z' not in 'apple'	         True

âœ… 7. Identity Operators
Compare the memory location of two objects.

Operator	Description	                Example	                     Result
is	  True if both refer to same object	a is b	             True if a and b are same object
is not	  True if they are not same object	a is not b	     True

ðŸ’¡ a = [1,2]; b = a â†’ a is b is True. 
   But a = [1,2]; b = [1,2] â†’ a is b is False (though values are same, they are different objects).


âœ… 8. Bitwise Operators
Works at the binary level (bit-by-bit).

Operator	Description	Example	                              Result
&	          AND	        5 & 3 â†’ 0101 & 0011 = 0001 = 1	
`	`	  OR	        `                                       5
~	          NOT	        ~5 = -6 (inverts bits)	
^	  XOR (exclusive OR)	5 ^ 3 â†’ 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 = 6
