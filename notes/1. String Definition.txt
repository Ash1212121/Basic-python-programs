 1. String Definition
String (str): A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (' ' or " ").

python
Copy
Edit
x = "python is a programming language"
This assigns a string to variable x.

✅ 2. print() Function
Displays output.

python
Copy
Edit
print(x)
✅ 3. type() Function
Returns the type of the variable.

python
Copy
Edit
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'str'>
✅ 4. len() Function
Returns the length (number of characters) in the string.

python
Copy
Edit
print(len(x))   # Output: 33
✅ 5. String Indexing
Each character in a string has a position (index), starting from 0.

python
Copy
Edit
print(x[19])    # Output: 'g' (20th character)
🧾 Indexing: Accessing a single character using x[index]

✅ 6. String Slicing
Used to extract a part (substring) from the string.

python
Copy
Edit
print(x[4:31])    # Characters from index 4 to 30
print(x[17:])     # From index 17 to end
print(x[:30])     # From beginning to index 29
🧾 Syntax: x[start:end]
Note: end is excluded.

✅ 7. Negative Indexing
Indexes from the end of the string.

python
Copy
Edit
print(x[-1])       # Last character: 'e'
print(x[-10:-2])   # Substring using negative indexes
print(x[-10:])     # Last 10 characters
print(x[:-2])      # Entire string except last 2 chars
✅ 8. Membership Operators: in, not in
Used to check if a substring exists in a string.

python
Copy
Edit
print("is" in x)        # True – 'is' is present
print("no" in x)        # False – 'no' not found
print("is" not in x)    # False
print("amal" not in x)  # True – 'amal' not in string

Great question!

✅ Code:
python
Copy
Edit
for i in x:
    print(i)
🧠 Explanation & Purpose:
🔁 for i in x:
This is a for loop used to iterate through each character in the string x.

x is a string: "python is a programming language"

The loop goes through each character one by one.

i takes the value of each character during every iteration.

🖨️ print(i)
This prints each character of the string x on a new line.

📝 What is it used for?
✅ It is used to iterate through a string, character by character.
